# Multi-Robot-Decision-Making-Framework
A framework for multi-robot task allocation and failover coordination in industrial automation scenarios. The system uses Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP) for initial optimal task assignment and Contract Net Protocol (CNP) for dynamic task reassignment when robot failures occur.

## Key Features:

DCOP-based Task Allocation: Optimal initial assignment of tasks across multiple robots.

CNP-based Failover: Real-time task reassignment when robots fail or become unavailable.

ROS2 Integration: Modular node architecture with real-time messaging and logging.

Dockerized Deployments: Reproducible builds and containerized simulation environments.

CI/CD Pipelines: Automated testing, linting, and deployment workflows using GitHub Actions.

Isaac Sim Integration: High-fidelity simulation of industrial environments for testing scalability and fault-tolerance.


## Use Cases:

Factory automation & logistics robotics

Swarm robotics research and prototyping

Multi-robot coordination in dynamic environments
